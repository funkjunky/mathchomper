//TODO TODO
GITHUB! pages.io!! gifted under tree with URL



// maybe have a high score, locally stored
-  if wrong number, then the monster exclaims above, then changes to moving towards the player, still slowly.
- add touch controls, 4 quadrants of screen to move up, down, left, right, middle to eat.
//maybe the monster slowly speeds up over time?
// maybe the muncher licks the numbers?
// maybe a random element: if the monster licks the number, it's worth less points?
// !! have a helper, "loves" "little hearts floating" the correct answer. Uses points.
